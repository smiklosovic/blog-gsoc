# This and the following lines beginning with '#' are the blog post header.
# Please take your time and replace these options with desired values. Just
# remember that the date has to be in the YYYY-MM-DD form, tags are a comma
# separated list of categories the post (pages ignore these) belong to, and
# the url,  if provided, should consist of alphanumeric characters, hyphens
# and underscores only.  Specifying your own url  is especially recommended
# in case you use non-ASCII characters in your blog post title.
